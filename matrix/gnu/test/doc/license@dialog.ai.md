This message looks like something you might post on a platform like Discord or Slack. While your intention might be to offer a good deal, it's important to be aware of several potential issues for both you and the people who might take you up on this offer.

Here are some important points to consider:

### 1. Violation of JetBrains' Terms of Service
JetBrains' educational licenses are strictly for personal, non-commercial use by students and educators. The terms state that these licenses **cannot be sold, transferred, or shared**.
*   **For the Buyer:** If JetBrains discovers the license was sold, they can revoke it at any time, and the buyer will lose their money and access.
*   **For the Seller:** Your own JetBrains account could be banned for violating the terms of service, preventing you from getting any future licenses.

### 2. The Official Free Student License
JetBrains offers a **completely free** All Products Pack for students and teachers. Anyone who is genuinely studying can likely get a license for free, directly from the official source.
*   You can direct people to the official **[JetBrains Educational Licenses page](https://www.jetbrains.com/community/education/#students)**.
*   This is the safest and most reliable way for students to get the software. They just need a student email or official documentation.

### 3. Risk of Scams
Even with your offer to "give the license first," this type of transaction in unofficial channels is very risky. People are often wary because:
*   The license could be fraudulent or obtained with a stolen credit card.
*   The seller could report the license as "stolen" after payment to get it back.
*   It creates a "gray market" that hurts the company and legitimate users.

### A Better Way to Help
If your goal is to help fellow students, instead of selling a license, you could post a message like this:

> "@everyone Hey everyone, if you're a student and need JetBrains tools like IntelliJ, PyCharm, or WebStorm for your studies, remember that you can get the **entire All Products Pack for FREE** directly from JetBrains!
>
> Just sign up with your student email here: [https://www.jetbrains.com/community/education/#students](https://www.jetbrains.com/community/education/#students)
>
> It's the official and safest way to get your license, and it lasts for a full year (and is renewable as long as you're a student). Happy coding!"

This approach is much safer, more helpful, and doesn't violate any terms of service. It points people to the legitimate, free resource they are entitled to as students.
