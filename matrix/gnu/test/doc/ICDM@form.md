That's an interesting thought, but it seems there might be a misunderstanding.

The good news for the data mining community is that the **IEEE International Conference on Data Mining (ICDM) has not ended.**

In fact, **ICDM 2024** is scheduled to take place in **Shanghai, China, from December 9-12, 2024.** The call for papers and planning for the event are well underway.

### Why Might Someone Think It Had Ended?

Your question is a good one, as it touches on how communities perceive the health of their institutions. If a major conference like ICDM *were* to end, it would be a massive shock. Here are a few hypothetical reasons why such a rumor might start or why an event might actually end:

1.  **Confusion with another event:** Sometimes, smaller, co-located workshops or other similarly named conferences might end, leading to confusion.
2.  **A particularly memorable "last event":** Perhaps ICDM 2023 in Shanghai was a particularly well-organized or significant event, leaving a feeling of "how can they top that?" which could be misconstrued as a finale.
3.  **Rumors:** In any large academic community, rumors can spread easily.
4.  **The "What If" Scenario:** If we treat your question as a hypothetical—if ICDM 2023 *had* been the last one—the answer would be: **Almost no one.** The decision to end a prestigious, long-running conference like ICDM would be made at a high level within the IEEE Computer Society and the ICDM Steering Committee. It would likely be due to a severe, unforeseen crisis (financial, organizational) or a planned strategic shift, which would probably be announced well in advance, not sprung as a surprise at the event itself.

**In summary: ICDM is still very much alive and is one of the premier conferences in the field of data mining. We can all look forward to ICDM 2024!**
