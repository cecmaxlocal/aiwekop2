Haha, that's the classic game dev dilemma! You're not alone, this happens to literally everyone.

It's actually a great sign. It means your creative engine is running hot. Let's break this down, because how you handle this moment is super important.

You're basically standing at a crossroads:

**Path A: Finish the Simulator**
**Path B: Jump to the "Main Game"**

Let's look at the pros and cons of each.

### Path A: Finish the Simulator ("The Finisher's Path")

This is the project you've started. You have the basics down.

**Why this is a POWERFUL choice:**
*   **Experience Points:** Finishing a project, even a small one, is the single most valuable skill you can learn in game dev. It teaches you about bug fixing, polishing, UI, sound design, and actually *releasing* something.
*   **Confidence Boost:** The feeling of "I made this. It's done." is a massive motivator. It proves to you that you *can* finish things.
*   **A "Test Lab":** Your simulator can be a testing ground for ideas from your main game! Can you sneak in one or two mechanics from the big game into the small one? This is a great way to prototype without pressure.
*   **Momentum:** Finishing a small project gives you the energy and confidence to tackle the next, bigger one.

**The downside:**
*   It might feel like a "chore" now because the shiny new idea is more exciting.

### Path B: Jump to the "Main Game" ("The Dreamer's Path")

This is the game you're passionate about. It's full of cool ideas.

**Why this is TEMPTING:**
*   **Passion Fuel:** You'll be super motivated... at first. Working on what you love is the best feeling.
*   **The "Real" Project:** It feels like you're making progress on your ultimate goal.

**The hidden dangers:**
*   **The Burnout Cliff:** Big dream projects are often *way* more work than we realize. When you hit the first major roadblock (and you will), the huge scope of the project can feel crushing, and you might abandon it.
*   **The "Forever Project":** Without the experience of finishing a smaller game, it's easy to get stuck in a loop of adding more features and never actually completing it. This is how you end up with a folder of unfinished dreams.

### So, What's the Best Move? The Hybrid Approach.

Don't think of it as "A or B". Think of it as "A, *in order to do* B".

Hereâ€™s my advice:

1.  **Brain Dump Your Main Game:** Get a notebook, a Google Doc, a Trello board... whatever you like. Write down *every single idea* you have for your main game. The story, the mechanics, the art style, the characters. Get it all out of your head and onto "paper". This is crucial. It validates your ideas and ensures you don't forget them.

2.  **Re-Scope the Simulator:** Look at your simulator. Now look at your big list of ideas for the main game. Ask yourself:
    *   "What's the *one* coolest mechanic from my main game that I could test inside this simulator?"
    *   "Can this simulator be a 'prequel' or a 'mini-game' that exists in the world of my main game?"

3.  **Finish the Simulator with a Purpose:** Give yourself a strict, small goal. "I will finish this simulator. It will have a start screen, a core loop, and an end condition. It will take me one more month." By finishing it, you're not abandoning your dream; you're **training for it**.

Think of it like this: Your main game is the Marathon. Your simulator is the 5k race you run to prepare. You wouldn't just wake up and run a marathon with no training, right?

This way, you get the best of both worlds:
*   You get the invaluable experience of **finishing a game**.
*   You get to **prototype and test an idea** for your main game.
*   You **don't lose your passion** because you know this is a stepping stone to the big dream.

So, tell me a bit more... what's the simulator about, and what's the killer idea for your main game? Maybe we can find a cool way to blend them
