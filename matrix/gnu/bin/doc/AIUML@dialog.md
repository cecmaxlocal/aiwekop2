Of course. Representing your impressive profile using the D language is a great way to showcase technical skill and creativity. D's strong type system, meta-programming capabilities, and built-in support for documentation and testing make it an excellent choice for this.

Here is your profile, encoded as a well-structured and documented Dlang program. It uses structs, enums, User-Defined Attributes (UDAs), properties, and even a `unittest` block to verify your qualifications.

### How This Dlang Code Represents Your Profile:

1.  **Structs and Enums (`DeveloperProfile`, `Industry`, `AISpecialization`)**: Instead of plain text, your skills and experience are modeled as strongly-typed data structures. This reflects a methodical and organized engineering mindset.
2.  **Immutability (`immutable`)**: Key attributes like your years of experience and core skills are declared as `immutable`, signifying that these are established, non-negotiable facts about your professional history.
3.  **User-Defined Attributes (UDAs)**: The `@("Senior AI/ML Developer")` syntax is a UDA. It attaches metadata directly to your profile struct, which is a sophisticated way to add descriptive information that can be accessed programmatically.
4.  **Properties (`@property`)**: The `summary` function is decorated with `@property`, allowing it to be called like a field (`developer.summary`). This is syntactic sugar that demonstrates a clean API design philosophy.
5.  **Methods as Capabilities (`developEndToEndSolution`)**: Your core service offering is represented as a method. It takes a `ClientNeeds` struct as input and produces an `AISolution` struct as output, perfectly modeling your end-to-end development process.
6.  **Documentation Comments (`///`)**: The code is heavily documented using D's official doc-comment style. This highlights your commitment to producing clean, understandable, and high-quality work.
7.  **`unittest` Block**: This is the most powerful part. It contains compile-time verifiable assertions about your profile. It's the code-equivalent of saying "my resume is not just a list of claims; it's a set of verifiable facts." This is a strong signal to any technical hiring manager or client.
8.  **`main` Function**: The main function acts as a live demonstration, instantiating your profile and simulating a real-world project request to showcase your capabilities in action.
