**Considering the Core Concept**

I'm currently fleshing out the 'Titan Tinder' concept.  The initial idea of a dating-style competition for AoT fans is intriguing.  I'm now focusing on how to make it creative and engaging, considering the competition format.  The primary hurdle is keeping the concept true to the franchise.


**Defining the Competition**

The initial idea of "Titan Tinder" has taken shape. I'm focusing on the competition mechanics: participants create Titan profiles. The humor comes from the clash between dating app conventions and the monstrous nature of Titans. I'm brainstorming the "matching" criteria; it won't be romantic, perhaps being the most fearsome or creative.


**Refining the Profile Concept**

I've been working on the profile creation aspect. The challenge is balancing the silliness with AoT's dark themes. I'm leaning toward allowing diverse profile formats: written bios, artistic representations (drawings, edits), or even short videos. The key is encouraging creativity within the Titan aesthetic. I'm focusing on defining clear and engaging judging criteria now.


**Developing the Judging Criteria**

I'm now focusing on how the judging will work. The challenge is defining clear, fair, and fun criteria. I'm considering categories like "Most Terrifying," "Most Creative Bio," and "Best Titan Aesthetic." I want to avoid anything too literal and encourage playful interpretations of the AoT universe. I'm thinking about including some specific AoT characters as "judges" (perhaps via voting) to add a layer of engagement.


**Developing the Rules Further**

I'm now refining the rules to ensure clarity and engagement. I'm focusing on "Profile Picture" ideas, ranging from silly self-portraits to action shots. For the Bio section, I'm thinking of prompts to encourage comedic, slightly dark entries. Finally, I'll brainstorm prizes aligned with the AoT universe, from titles to thematic "rewards."


**Expanding the Rules and Prizes**

I've been working on expanding the ruleset. I'm focusing on "Profile Picture" ideas, ranging from silly self-portraits to action shots. For the Bio section, I'm thinking of prompts to encourage comedic, slightly dark entries. Finally, I'll brainstorm prizes aligned with the AoT universe, from titles to thematic "rewards." I'm currently working on crafting the judging criteria to make it a fair but fun competition.


**Expanding the Competition Concept**

I'm now focusing on the competitive aspects. The basic concept is in place, and I've established the judging categories to make it fair. I'm brainstorming fun profile prompts, and thematic prizes. The challenge now is crafting the announcement to ensure it grabs attention. I'm focusing on the ruleset next.


**Expanding the Competition Concept**

I'm currently focused on the competition announcement. I'm crafting a fun and engaging way to introduce the "Titan Tinder" concept to fans. I'm focusing on crafting a set of rules and exciting prizes. The challenge is in the announcement tone and ensuring that the audience is engaged. I'm now drafting the call to action.

\n\nI'm now putting the finishing touches on the announcement text. The goal is to create a sense of fun and excitement, capturing the spirit of both dating apps and Attack on Titan. I've focused on clarity, humor, and AoT-specific language. I've also incorporated the user's suggestions and preferences. I believe the final draft will successfully grab the users attention, and get users involved.
